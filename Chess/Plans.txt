FIX:
	- when holding piece some images are layer up (try to change layer of it)

- when pawn gets to finish it can transform to any piece
- add en passant move
- king shouldnt be able to move to a place which is being attacked by other players piece
- add castle move for rook and king - everything will be checked in king move method even if rook already made a move
- add checkmate - right now player has to kill king to win
